            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>AFter the happy Coronation of Their Majeſties King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> was on the <hi>11th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> 1689. ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> with all the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence, Pomp and Splendor of a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Nation, ſpreading a general Joy through every Corner of the Land, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying a ſound of Triumph even to the fartheſt Shoar; divers great Officers and Miniſters of State, and others fitly qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified for the Intereſt of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, made and intruſted, and as a Loyal Gratitude and great Example to others; on the <hi>12th</hi> of <hi>April</hi> the Knights, Citizens and Burgeſſes then Aſſembled in Parliament, waited upon their Majeſties to Congratulate their Coronation, which was done by <hi>Henry
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:38581:4"/>Powle</hi> Eſquire, their Speaker, and had the Honour to kiſs their Majeſties hands; and on the <hi>19th</hi> following both Houſes Addreſſed his Majeſty, to render him Thanks for his Declaration, and repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Aſſurances that he will maintain the Church of <hi>England</hi> as by Law, and that he would be pleaſed to Summon a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of the Clergy of the Kingdom, to conſider more fully of the Matters in point of Religion, which was accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly done.</p>
            <p>And the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> tho' incommoded with Inſurrections in the <hi>Highlands,</hi> not to be behind-hand in Loyalty, to a Prince who had put his Life and all that was dear to him in the, Ballance, to reſcue them from impendent Ruine; having declared the King and Queen Soveraigns of that Kingdom, put forth a Proclamation, that none ſhould preſume to own, or acknowledge the late King <hi>James</hi> the Seventh for their King, obey, accept or aſſiſt any Order, or Commiſſion, that ſhould be admitted by him, or any way to correſpond with him by writing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and Commiſſioners were nominated to go for <hi>England,</hi> to offer the Crown to their preſent Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties, and they took all convenient Care
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:38581:4"/>to raiſe Forces, to quiet and ſuppreſs thoſe that diſturbed the publick Peace; upon which, the Viſcount <hi>Dundee</hi> who headed a Party of the Rebels, retired to the North, with about 80 Horſe; but ſoon after his number increaſed, as will appear in the Series of this Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Gourdon</hi> upon the firſt Account of the Revolution in <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c. having ſeized the Caſtle of <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bungh,</hi> the ſtrongeſt Hold in <hi>Scotland,</hi> he was cloſely beſieged and preſſed ſo ſtraitly, that all Communication was cut off: But the bleeding State of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was to be conſidered, where the late King was already Landed, and as well a formidable Army as a confuſed Rabble of Papiſts, with all the Outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges imaginable, oppreſſed the Proteſtants, by plundering and burning their Houſes, impriſoning their Perſons, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a univerſal Maſſacre; ſo that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding an Order of Imbargo in <hi>Scotland,</hi> Ships were allowed to go over to fetch off thoſe miſerable People, that fled the Perſecution of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable Enemies, and ſtood trembling on the Shoar, in hopes of a ſeaſonable opportunity to be tranſported.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:38581:5"/>
            <p>The Parliament of <hi>England</hi> being highly ſenſible of the Danger <hi>Ireland</hi> was in; there being a great many For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and other Supplies Landed from <hi>France,</hi> and many Towns, not Tenable, abandoned and ſwept away, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons Addreſſed his Majeſty in theſe Words.</p>
            <q>
               <p>WE your Majeſties moſt Loyal and Dutiful Subjects, the Commons in this preſent Parliament, Aſſembled, moſt humbly lay before Your Majeſty our earneſt Deſires that Your Majeſty would be pleaſed to take into Your moſt ſerious Conſideration, the Deſtructive Methods taken of late Years by the French King, againſt the Trace, Quiet, and Intereſt of Your Kingdom, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the preſent Invaſion of Your King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Ireland,</hi>  and ſupporting Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Rebellious Subjects; there not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the leaſt, but through Your Majeſties Wiſdom, the Alliance already made with ſuch, as may be hereafter concluded on this occaſion by Your Majeſty, may be effectual to reduce the <hi>French</hi>  King to ſuch a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it may not be in his Power here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, to violate the Peace of <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>  nor prejudice the Trade and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity of this Your Majeſties Kingdom.</p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:38581:5"/>
               <p>To this end, We moſt humbly beſeech Your Majeſty to reſt aſſured upon this our hearty and ſolemn Promiſe and Engagement, that when Your Majeſty ſhall think fit to enter into a War againſt the <hi>French</hi>  King, We will give Your Majeſty ſuch Aſſiſtance in a Parliamentary way; as may enable Your Majeſty (under the Protection and Bleſſing of God Almighty has ever afforded you) to ſupport and go through with the ſame.</p>
            </q>
            <p>To this Requeſt and Reſolution of the Commons, very grateful to the Nation, His Majeſty was pleaſed to Anſwer,  <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>I Receive this Addreſs as a Mark of the Confidence you have in me, which I take very kindly, and ſhall endeavour by all my Actions to confirm you in it: I aſſure you, That my own Ambition ſhall never be an Argument to incline me to ingage in a War, that may expoſe the Nation either to Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or Expence, but in the preſent Caſe I look upon the War ſo much already declared, in effect with <hi>France</hi>  againſt <hi>England,</hi>  that it is not ſo much an Act of Choice, as an inevitable Neceſſity in Our own defence.</p>
               <p>I ſhall only tell you, That as I have ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured my Life, and all that is dear to me,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:38581:6"/>to reſcue this Nation from what is ſuffered, I am ready ſtill to do the ſame, in order to the preſerving it from all its Enemies, and as I do not doubt, of ſuch an Aſſiſtance from you, as ſhall be ſutable to your Advice to me, to declare War againſt a powerful Enemy; ſo you may rely upon me, That no part of that which you ſhall give for the carrying it on with Succeſs, ſhall by Me be diverted to any other uſe</p>
            </q>
            <p>And that the World might ſee the King was in earneſt, he put out a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration to encourage the <hi>French</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants to tranſport themſelves into <hi>England,</hi> by which thoſe large Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories muſt of neceſſity be weakened, they making no inconſiderable number. Alſo a Proclamation prohibiting the Importation of all ſorts of Manufactures, or Commodities whatſoever, of the Growth, Product, or Manufacture of <hi>France;</hi> which were as the Lightning forerunning the Thunder-bolt, <hi>viz.</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation of War; and His Majeſty going to the Parliament Houſe, and ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Throne; he gave his Royal Aſſent to an Act, for raiſing Money by Poll, and otherwiſe towards the redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and an Act for preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Doubts and Queſtions, concerning

            <p>During theſe happy Tranſactions in <hi>England,</hi> things went with a high hand in <hi>Ireland</hi> on the Popiſh ſide, though the Proteſtants few in number, were not wanting to make all the Reſiſtance they could, whilſt the more Timerous, ſuch as could get off, left the Kingdom and the greateſt parts of their Effects behind them; though the Maſters of Ships, on pain of Death, were command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to carry them off.

            <p>About ſix days after this Sea Encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, their Majeſties were pleaſed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce War againſt the <hi>French</hi> King, the Declaration bearing Date the <hi>7th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> declaring the Reaſons, Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Juſtneſs of the War; moſt of the Confederates now in Alliance, having done the like before.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>11th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> his Majeſty gave the Royal Aſſent, to an Act, for the better ſecuring the Government by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arming Papiſts, and reputed Papiſts; with divers other Acts; and a Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation was exhibited for amoving Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts and reputed Papiſts, from the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and ten miles diſtant, except ſuch as were qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified to ſtay by reaſon of their Places, Stations, or Vocations, as ſpecified by an Act Entituled, <hi>An Act for amoving Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Commiſſioners from the Eſtates of <hi>Scotland,</hi> being now arrived, <hi>viz.</hi> The Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> Sir <hi>James Montgomery,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Dalrimple,</hi> to offer the Crown of that Kingdom; they waited upon
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:38581:7"/>their Majeſties, ſeated on the Throne un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Canopy of State in the Banquetting-houſe, and firſt preſented a Letter from the Eſtates to his Majeſty, then an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of Government; and Thirdly, a Paper containing the Grievances which they deſired might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed; and then an Addreſs to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty for turning the meeting of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates into a Parliament, all Signed by his Grace the Duke of <hi>Hamilton</hi> Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the Meeting, and read to their Majeſties; upon which the King was pleaſed to return a favourable Anſwer.</p>
            <p>After this the Coronation Oath was tendred, the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi> ſpeaking the words, and the King and Queen holding up their Right hands, after the manner of taking Oaths in <hi>Scotland,</hi> repeating them after him: Their Majeſties having Signed the Coronation Oath, and the Commiſſioners, and the <hi>Scotch</hi> Nobility preſent, had the Honour to kiſs their Hands. About this time the Duke of <hi>Schomberg,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Devonſhire</hi> were inſtalled Knights, Companions of the Noble Order of the Garter.</p>
            <p>The Fleet that had engaged the <hi>French,</hi> being put into <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> his Majeſty went thither, being every where recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:38581:8"/>with all the Demonſtrations of Joy, where he was pleaſed to dive on, and declared his Royal Intention of conferring the Title of Earl of this Kingdom upon the Admiral, and accordingly he was afterward created Earl of <hi>Torrington,</hi> Baron of <hi>Torbay, &amp;c.</hi> Captain <hi>Shovel,</hi> and Captain <hi>Aſhby</hi> were then Knighted, and ſuch as were engaged with the <hi>French</hi> had Ten Shillings a man beſtowed on him as a Donative.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>24th.</hi> of <hi>May</hi> his Majeſty gave the Royal Aſſent to an Act for Exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Majeſties Proteſtant Subjects diſſenting from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> from the Penalties of certain Laws, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Eſtates of <hi>Scotland</hi> meeting on the fifth of <hi>June,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Hamilton</hi> acquainted them, That His Majeſty had been pleaſed to ſend him a Commiſſion, to repreſent his Royal Perſon in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing Parliament; and that the had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Inſtruction from His Majeſty, to give His conſent to an Act, for the turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Meeting of the Eſtates into a Parliament, and then to Adjourn to the 17th. all which was performed, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly obſerved; and the Engliſh Forces under the Command of Major-General <hi>Mackay,</hi> and others, being entered that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:38581:8"/>Kingdom, the D. of <hi>Gourdon,</hi> who till this time, had poſſeſſion of the Caſtle, finding no hopes of Relief, ſurrendred it upon divers Articles, to Sir <hi>John Lanier;</hi> and ſo that important place that had for a long time been a Terrour to the City of <hi>Edinborugh,</hi> as Commanding it with its Cannon, was put into ſafe Hands, the Duke caſting himſelf wholly upon the King's Mercy, without making any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle for himſelf, although he took care to do it for others, ſaying, <hi>He had ſo much reſpect for all the Princes of King</hi> James <hi>the Sixth's Line, as not to make Conditions with them for his own particular Intereſt;</hi> ſo he rendred himſelf entirely to King <hi>William</hi>'s Diſcretion; and the Parliament meeting according to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, paſſed an Act for <hi>Recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, and Aſſerting Their Majeſties Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> and accordingly took the Oaths; and a Correſpondency in the Army be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcovered to be held with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, Lientenant Collonel <hi>Levingſton</hi> and other Officers were ſeized, and made Priſoners; ſo that a timely Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very defeated the whole Deſign; and being brought upon their Tryals, before a Council of War, and ſeverally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed their Crime, throwing themſelves
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:38581:9"/>upon the King's Mercy; and a Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation publiſhed for apprehending the Viſcount <hi>Dundee,</hi> and others his Aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates, with a Reward of a 8000 Marks, Scotch Money, to ſuch as ſhould appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend <hi>Dundee,</hi> and deliver him to any of His Majeſties Officers, dead, or alive; and indeed, he ſurvived not long after; for on the 26th of <hi>July,</hi> Major-General <hi>Mackay</hi> marching from St. <hi>Johnſtoun</hi> with about 4000. Foot, and 40 Troops of Horſe, and Dragoons, Two Mile on this ſide the Blaye of <hi>Athol,</hi> came within ſight of the Enemy, and drew up his Men to attack them; and on the 27th. the Fight began about Five in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, and continued very hot for ſome time, ſo that being exceeded in number, ſome of our Regiments gave way; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, <hi>Dundee</hi> Charging furiouſly at the head of the <hi>Highlanders,</hi> to encourage them was ſlain by a Shot, although he had Armour; which ſo diſcouraged his Party, that they ſuddenly retreated; and after that, Collonel <hi>Cannon,</hi> who had been ſent out of <hi>Ireland</hi> with ſome Forces, took upon him the Command, and rallied the ſcattered Rebels: As for the Body of the Viſcount <hi>Dundee,</hi> it was afterward expoſed in <hi>Blaire</hi> Church, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:38581:9"/>then decently buried; and with him his Party loſt, the Prime of their Courage, never after being able to make any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Head; though the Earl of <hi>Dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferling,</hi> and others, undertook to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age them; for many of the <hi>Highlanders</hi> ſcattered, and went home, and ſome of the Heads of their Clans ſubmitted.</p>
            <p>During theſe Tranſactions in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Army in <hi>England</hi> marched from all parts towards <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and <hi>Highlake,</hi> to embark on the Ships appointed, under the Command of the Duke of <hi>Schomberg,</hi> conſiſting of between Five and Twenty, and Thirty Thouſand effectual Men, great Stores of Ammunition, Proviſion, and conſiderable quantities of Moneys were Shipped off, and his Majeſty ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a Camp to be on <hi>Hounſlow-Heath</hi> on the <hi>14th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> to be compoſed of ſuch Forces as remained; but it continued not above three or four days; and in the mean time a Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of War againſt <hi>France</hi> was publiſhed in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During theſe Tranſactions, the <hi>Iniskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>-men being in Arms, made many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions into the Enemies Quarters, beat ſeveral of their Party, and poſſeſſed themſelves of a great deal of Plunder;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:38581:10"/>and upon notice that one <hi>Maccarty</hi> was abroad with a ſtrong Detachment, marching towards <hi>Liſnaskea,</hi> Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Collonel <hi>Berry</hi> early the next day marched out with 8 Troops of Horſe, 2 of Dragoons, and 3 Companies of Foot; but upon a ſerious ſearch finding the Enemy, with whom another Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was joyned, much ſuperiour in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, he ſent to Collonel <hi>Wooſly</hi> at <hi>Inis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>killing</hi> for Relief, and after a brisk En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter killing a conſiderable Number, put the reſt to flight; but they rally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again upon new Reinforcements, another hot Engagement happened near <hi>Newtown Butler,</hi> where having poſted themſelves advantageouſly, they gauled our Horſe with their Cannon; but our Foot and dragoons paſſing the Defiles, drove them from their Poſts, and ſeized their Cannon, whereby the Horſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving advantage to come up, the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Horſe upon the firſt charge deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Foot, and they finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a great ſtrait, fled likewiſe; many being killed and taken; inſomuch that that Party that had ſo long haz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>London-Derry</hi> was a place extreamly aimed at, and not doubted to be won, yet they found themſelves miſtaken in their Account, as in the Relation of that Siege, though but briefly, will even to a wonderful Providence be manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; indeed upon the firſt Approach they made themſelves Maſter of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of <hi>Culmore,</hi> where were only 3 pieces of Cannon, and the Garriſon diſtreſſed for Water; and although they made Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions to march out with their Swords, yet were they plundered by the <hi>Iriſh:</hi> And now to wave Interruption in the Thread of Hiſtory, though many things intervened, take a brief Account of this famous Siege, the greateſt, conſidering the Situation and weakneſs of the place, againſt a numerous Army, that has been perhaps in many Ages.</p>
            <p>This City was built by divers Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of the City of <hi>London,</hi> upon their Settlement of Collonies in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as a Fortreſs againſt the Incurſions of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and named by its Original Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders <hi>London-Derry,</hi> and ſo proſperouſly is ſucceeded, that it has hitherto baffled their moſt ſtrenuous Attempts, and as if
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:38581:11"/>Providence had ſo ordered, to defeat the Councils of <hi>Tyrconnel.</hi> Upon the firſt News of the Invaſion, all the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Forces were drawn out of it, being moſtly Papiſts, and ſent into <hi>England</hi> to aſſiſt the late King; inſomuch, that the Proteſtants without much Difficulty took Poſſeſſion of it, when they were forced from other places; and when Collonel <hi>Lundy</hi> and others deſpaired of holding it, as a place not Tenable againſt ſuch a numerous Army, as drew down againſt it, though conſiderable Forces were ſent from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and ſafely arrived under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Collonels <hi>Richards</hi> and <hi>Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningham;</hi> it being abandoned by thoſe Commanders, the enraged People reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to defend it, againſt the utmoſt Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of the Enemy; and thereupon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding to chooſe Mr. <hi>George Walker</hi> a Miniſter, and Major <hi>Baker</hi> their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours during the Siege, they choſe Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels, and Regimented their men, in all amounting to 117 Companies, each Company conſiſting of 60 men, the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal 7020 Soldiers, and 341 Officers; and then a View being had of the Stores, and neceſſary Orders given, all Offers made by the Enemy of Favour and Protection were refuſed; ſo that finding a defence
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:38581:11"/>was reſolved upon, they drew up a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi-culverin within 118 Pearches of the Town, and played without any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Damage; unleſs to the Market-houſe, whereupon a Sally was made, and 200 of the Enemy killed, together with <hi>Mamow</hi> the <hi>French</hi> General, and other Officers of note; and although the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies Horſe came up furiouſly, yet no more of our ſide than four private Soldiers, and Lieutenant <hi>Mac Phedris</hi> were killed; but the Beſiegers not ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this available, planted four Demi-cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verins at the lower end of an Orchard, and thoſe playing Inceſſantly, hurt divers People in their Houſes and other places; but the Cannon playing as furiouſly from the Town killed a great many of their men, and ſeveral Officers of note, as Lieutenant <hi>Fitz Patrick,</hi> Lieutenant Collonel <hi>Oneas, &amp;c.</hi> together with two Fryars, who were zealous in the Cauſe. And to make more effectual work, they placed ſome Mortars, and threw in divers Bombs, which did little or no Execution; but to prevent further miſchief. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged made another vigorous Sally, and killed ſeveral of the Enemy at <hi>Penniburn</hi>-Hill, in which Action they loſt only 2 men, and had 18 wounded, and farther

            <p>On the <hi>4th</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> the Beſieged made an Attack at a Windmill work with a Body of Horſe and Foot, the former be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſtly compoſed of Gentlemen, had bound themſelves in an Oath to mount the Beſiegers Line; but although they came on in good Order with loud Huzzas, they were beaten off; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Foot had Faggots, and after thoſe failed them, they took up dead Bodies to defend them againſt the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieges, and the Horſe had moſtly Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, yet 4000 of them were killed, with the loſs of about 6 on our ſide; and Captain <hi>Butlers</hi> being taken Priſoner by too eagerly preſſing after the Enemy, and ſome few killed by their great Shot from the other ſide the Water, but in the Night-time the Enemy played their Bombs of 273 pound weight, which in their fall ploughed up the Streets, and broke down ſeveral Houſes, and killed ſeveral ſick People, that were not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of leaving their Houſes, and in

Wherefore, to keep them in Action, the better to prevent it, about the middle
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:38581:24"/>of <hi>February,</hi> upon Advice the Enemy was in motion near <hi>Dundalk,</hi> he drew out a ſtrong Party and marched to <hi>Dramore,</hi> whilſt Collonel <hi>la Melionere</hi> and Sir <hi>John Lanier,</hi> who advanced as far as <hi>Carlingford,</hi> returned with an Account, that only three Regiments of the Enemy were at <hi>Dundalk;</hi> that Garriſon, as likewiſe <hi>Drogheda,</hi> contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their former Garriſons without any Reinforcement; upon which moſt of our Troops were commanded back, only a flying Party of 500 Horſe and Dragoons, with a like number of Foot, were ſent abroad to obſerve the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Enemy, and keep them from plundering the Country; between whom and the Out-Parties ſome Skirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing happened.</p>
            <p>The General being returned to his head Quarters at <hi>Lisburn,</hi> received an Account from Collonel <hi>Wooſly</hi> of a great defeat he had given the Enemy at the Town of <hi>Cavan,</hi> the Particulars were, That Marching from <hi>Belturbat</hi> with a Detachment of 300 Horſe, and 700 Foot, he paſſed the River at Night, two Miles beyond <hi>Calyhay's;</hi> but it was not done ſo ſecretly, but the Enemies Scouts diſcovered it, and gave the Alarm by
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:38581:25"/>firing their Muskets, and making a great fire upon the Hill. However, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the badneſs of the Ways, he got to the. Town about half an hour after day-break; when contrary to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation he found the Duke of <hi>Berwick</hi> arrived that Night with 2500 men, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with the Garriſon about 4000, drawn up in good order near the Fort; but the Collonel diſpoſing of his men as the Ground would give a Convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, he charged the enemy; and after an hours hot diſpute beat them out of the Field; in which Action the Duke of <hi>Berwick</hi> had his Horſe ſhot under him, and Collonel <hi>O Rely,</hi> Governour of <hi>Cavan,</hi> was killed on the ſpot, with two Lieutenant-Collonels, and divers others of Note: Whereupon our men entered the Town and fell to plunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; which the Enemy perceiving, made a ſtrong Sally from the Fort, and had cut off a great many of them in that Diſorder, had not the Collonel came opportunely in with a freſh Reſerve of about 250 Foot, and 80 Horſe; and to get his Souldiers out of the Town, he found himſelf conſtrained to ſet it on Fire, and having quitted it, and joyned thoſe that were fighting, the Enemy
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:38581:25"/>about 150 ſtrong were beaten into the Fort with conſiderable loſs; but the Army being tired out in the Action, it was not thought convenient to attack it at that time; and this firing the Town proved very diſadvantageous, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Plunder that might have been had, for all the Houſes were full of Bread, Meal, Oats, Beans, and the like; Stores to ſuffice the Garriſon for ſix Months. And here it was reported by the Priſoners, that the Duke of <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> was to command a Body of 10000 men, to be detached out of all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments, and ſo to make Incurſions as he ſaw Opportunity; but by this defeat the deſign was fruſtrated, for all the Ammunition that was in the Town was blown up.

            <p>About this time the Queen of <hi>Spain</hi> being on Board under a Convoy of a Squadron of Engliſh-men of War, and being upon our Coaſt, the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> was ſent to Complement her Majeſty in the Name of Their Majeſties of <hi>England,</hi> and it was performed with much Ceremony and Grandeur; and the Wind ſoon after coming about fair, ſhe arrived ſafe in the <hi>Groin,</hi> and ſo paſſed to <hi>Madrid,</hi> and the Engliſh Ships after having this Honour, were diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with liberal Gratitude to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders.</p>

And on the 19th his Majeſty went from <hi>Belfaſt</hi> to <hi>Hilsburg,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Loubricklin,</hi> and the <hi>Newry;</hi> the Forces marching in two Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: And ſoon after they Encamped on the Plains of <hi>Dundalk.</hi> In the mean while a conſiderable Body of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my lay about <hi>Ardee,</hi> there Intrenching themſelves as if they were bent upon a deſperate Oppoſition.</p>
            <p>Since we have made this Progreſs in Affairs, it may not be amiſs to look a little back and conſider what happened in relating to <hi>Dublin,</hi> the Metropolis of <hi>Ireland,</hi> upon King <hi>William</hi>'s Arriving in that Kingdom: The Camp before his Landing had been laid out about

               <hi>Dublin</hi> to joyn them with about 6000 <hi>French</hi> Foot, moſt old Soldiers well Armed and Clad. One Regiment of theſe were <hi>Dutch</hi> Proteſtants, who were narrowly obſerved for fear o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> deſerting. The whole <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army was compoſed of about 36000 men, beſides 15000 which remained in Garriſons <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and the ſame day the Late King left the Town, there marched in 6000 of the Country <hi>Militia,</hi> and the Collonels <hi>Luttrel</hi> and <hi>Mac Gillicuddy,</hi> as his Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, were left Governours.</p>
            <p>It was expected the <hi>Iriſh</hi> would have been diſheartned upon the News of King <hi>William</hi>'s Landing, and the late Kings leaving the Town; but on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, boy'd up with vain hope, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced, as if they had got the King of <hi>England</hi> in their Poſſeſſion, and the day their own; being too fondly aſſured, the <hi>French</hi> Fleet would cut off his return, or that an Inſurrection would be made in <hi>England,</hi> as being told, that 100000 men were ready to riſe, under the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of declaring for a Common-wealths
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:38581:33"/>ſo that the Proteſtants knew not what to think, being moſtly Impriſoned, or under Reſtraint; and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts were ſo aſſured of Succeſs, that ſome of them told their Proteſtant Friends, they would be glad to go to Maſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a Twelve-month; and this hope af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward appeared to be grounded on the little Intelligence the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had of the ſtrength of the Iriſh Army, as was manifeſted by the Letters of <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> to the late Queen in <hi>France,</hi> ſurpriſed at <hi>Dundalk;</hi> yet this gave the Proteſtants an apprehenſion of their Houſes being burnt, and plundered, in caſe the Iriſh Army was worſted, of whoſe Succeſs they had not the leaſt thought, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Cowardice, where they came upon equal terms; for they had neglected at all times, to fortifie the place; and on the <hi>19th.</hi> when the late King was gone to encamp, the Governour order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all People walking the Streets with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Bayonets, or Swords, to be taken up; for the Papiſts had a ſecret notice not to go without them, ſo that this fell upon the Proteſtants only, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly many were ſecured, out of which they culled thoſe they ſuſpected. and ſent them to divers Priſons, and then
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:38581:34"/>they put out a Proclamation, <hi>That not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Five Proteſtants ſhould meet in any place above the Family, upon pain of Death;</hi> and thereupon the Churches were ſhut up, which, by an extraordinary Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, had been kept open, except <hi>Chriſt</hi>-Church, and frequently twice every day at Prayers; for although the Proteſtant Clergy that remained there had loſt their Subſiſtance, by an Act of the Iriſh Parliament, yet the People voluntarily contributed with great Zeal and Diligence, ſo that they acquitted themſelves bravely; being particularly influenced by the Biſhop of <hi>Meath,</hi> and Dr. <hi>King,</hi> Dean of St. <hi>Patricks;</hi> but the latter was on the <hi>24th.</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> made Priſoner in the Caſtle, and many other Proteſtants of note in the College, now made a Garriſon, and other publick pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The <hi>Galloway</hi> Proteſtants, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 200. having been thoſe of Sir <hi>Tho. Southwell</hi>'s Party, brought up in order to be exchanged, were removed from <hi>White Fryars,</hi> to the Round Church, and all the <hi>Newgate</hi> Priſoners were put to them, where they were almoſt ſtifled; as for thoſe that had been made Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of War, they were brought from <hi>Kilmainham</hi> to St. <hi>John</hi>'s Church; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:38581:34"/>that the liberal Contributions raiſed every Sabbath-day, for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, was intercepted, and they reduced to great Extremity; few Proteſtants da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to walk the Streets.</p>
            <p>This was the Caſe of the Citizens of <hi>Dublin,</hi> before the Battel of the <hi>Boyne;</hi> and it was given out, That the late King reſolved as much as in him lay, to avoid Fighting, deſigning to weary out the Engliſh, by walking them along the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ſuppoſing it was impoſſible for them to paſs it, ſeeing his Forces, as he thought, were ſufficiently ſtrong, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Banks at ſuch a diſadvantage; and after he had done that, to croſs the Country, to <hi>Limerick:</hi> However, as it appeared, he diſtruſted the Iſſue; for to provide againſt the worſt, he ſent to Sir <hi>Patrick Trant,</hi> firſt Commiſſioner of the Revenue, and another Gentleman for <hi>Waterford,</hi> there to prepare Ships for carrying him off, if the Army was defeated, as apprehending, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the violent puſhing on of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh towards <hi>Dublin,</hi> he could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent coming to a Battel within Ten days, unleſs he abandoned the defence of that City, which he then ſeemed reſolute to defend; yet ſoon after advancing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:38581:35"/>and changing his Meaſures, divers Councils were held to various purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Some light Skirmiſhes happened in divers parts of the Kingdom, and our Party abroad brought in conſiderable Booties, the main Body of the Army ſtill watching the motion of the Enemy, ſo that they had little reſt, and every day grew nearer to a Battel, ſo that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was wanting to draw it on, but the Enemies ſtanding a Field, which was wiſhed by our Soldiers, full of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and Vigour, bearing the fatigue of much Duty, and frequent Marches; promiſing in their Looks, and Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, a proſperous Event.</p>
            <p>Now the Enemy being encamped at <hi>Dundalk,</hi> and having ſecured it; as likewiſe the Bridge, called, <hi>Four-mile</hi>-Bridge, which made it difficult for our Army to force the paſſage; it was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Forces ſhould March to <hi>Market-Hill,</hi> and from thence to fall into the great Road that leads from <hi>Armagh</hi> to <hi>Dundalk;</hi> whereupon his Majeſty order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Major <hi>Scravemore</hi> with a Detachment of 300 Horſe, and 200 Dragoons, to obſerve the Road, and viſit the Paſſes; alſo to find out a convenient place to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp in, &amp; approach as near as poſſible to

            <p>This great Defeat, and ſcattering of the Enemies Forces brought a ſear upon the Garriſons they had left, and the Town of <hi>Wexford,</hi> being deſerted by its Governour, it declared for the King, which happened in this manner: Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Butler,</hi> Lord Lieutenant of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, paſſing after the late King upon his Flight, ſent for his Son to follow him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>France;</hi> as likewiſe to Captain <hi>O Kelly,</hi> who Commanded the Caſtle, to ſet it on fire, and bring away his Company; but this Letter falling into a Proteſtant Gentleman's Hands, he concealed the firing part of the Letter, ſo that the Caſtle eſcaped; and after this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany was withdrawn, the Proteſtants roſe, and diſarming the Papiſts, ſent to the King to acquaint him with what had paſſed; who, thereupon, ſent to ſecure it, and many other places followed its Example. And now the King, to give the poor deluded People that had been drawn into this War, an aſſurance of his Protection, put forth his Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Pardon to the Iriſh Commonalty, that returned to their Allegiance, and would live peaceably, and look after the Harveſt, to get it in for a Winter Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, being ordered to pay thoſe Rents

            <p>During this glorious Succeſs in the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> it was ſomething clouded nearer home, for the French King to favour his Deſign in <hi>Ireland,</hi> in the beginning of <hi>June,</hi> ſet forth the greateſt Fleet that ever ſaluted the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean, from <hi>France,</hi> and ſtood to our Coaſt, to make a ſhew to fight our Fleet, then under the Command of the Earl of <hi>Torrington,</hi> our Admiral, who on the 24th. of <hi>June</hi> ſailed from St. <hi>Hellens,</hi> the Wind at North Eaſt, and ſtood towards the French Fleet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which was ſeen the Evening before off of <hi>Freſh water-gate,</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> in order, as it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, to fight them; but the Wing ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them ſhort, he came to an Anchor off of <hi>Dunnoſe,</hi> within Five Leagues of the French, who at Eight the next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, were at Anchor in <hi>Compton-Bay,</hi> ſo that every one was big with the Expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:38581:41"/>of an Engagement, the French no ways ſeeming to decline it, and our Men were full of Courage, and deſirous of nothing more than to be at it; and that Afternoon their Majeſties Ship the <hi>Lyon,</hi> and ſeveral Dutch men of War, joyned our Fleet, and many other addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Strengths were joyned by ſuch Ships coming in, as had been cruzing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and on the 30th. of <hi>June,</hi> off of <hi>Beechy,</hi> the two Fleets drew up in Lines, and about Nine in the Morning, the Dutch that had the Vanguard fell on, and fought very bravely, as likewiſe ſome of the Engliſh; but not being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded, by reaſon of the Admiral's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected ſtanding away; ſeveral of the Dutch Ships were burnt, and ſunk, and the Engliſh that ſought much, bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, though not without doing conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable damage to the Enemy: this Fight continued till towards the Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, when the French bear away, and came afterwards to an Anchor: The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Officers killed, were the Dutch Rear-Admiral <hi>Jan Dick,</hi> Rear-Admiral <hi>Brackle,</hi> and Captain <hi>Nordle.</hi> Of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, Captain <hi>Botham,</hi> and Captain <hi>Pum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy,</hi> with two Captains of the Marine Regiments, and Captain <hi>Goes</hi> loſt his

            <p>The States-General having received the News of his unhappy Miſchance, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled without any Conſternation, and after ſome Debate, gave expreſs Orders for the building of Fourteen new Men of War, and all hands were employed in that work, that their <hi>Quota</hi> might be extraordinary, as ſoon as the Seas would
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:38581:44"/>give leave to be in Action of this kind. And to proceed farther in this Matter, it is reported in a Letter, that a perſon of Honour ſent from <hi>England</hi> to the Lord <hi>Darſly,</hi> that the <hi>Holland</hi> Squadron be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved themſelves with ſo much Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vety, that if the L. <hi>T.</hi> had fought, in all probability, we had won an abſolute Victory.</p>
            <p>Had our Fleet been as ſucceſsfull as His Majeſties Arms in <hi>Ireland,</hi> no doubt, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>France</hi> had trembled, and looked pale, and even the hopes of thoſe that wiſhed well to our Enemies, had ſunk into Deſpair, of having them fulfilled, and ſoon dwindled into nothing; and indeed, this Miſcarriage in a large man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, bore up the Spirits of the Iriſh, and Scotch in Rebellion, to whom the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage was magnified to the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, inſomuch, that it was credibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported amongſt them, that the Engliſh Fleet was deſtroyed, and a mighty Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of French landed, and joyned with ſuch as were in Arms for the late King's Cauſe, and perhaps it was ſo agreed in ſecret Confederacies: but it ſucceeded not, the mighty Project being fruſtrated, and blaſted, by the vigilancy of thoſe in Power, and the readineſs, and chearful
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:38581:44"/>undertaking of the <hi>Militia,</hi> taking Arms in their reſpective Countries, to oppoſe the Invading Enemy, and keeping under ſuch as were willing to give them any Aſſiſtance, had their Attempt been more proſperous, as no doubt, ſome reſtleſs Spirits wiſhed it might have been.</p>
            <p>Whilſt the French Fleet was on the Coaſt, labouring to gain Intelligence, by ſending their Boats, and other ways, of the Power and Strength of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, one <hi>Godfrey Croſs,</hi> an Inn-keeper in <hi>Kent,</hi> was ſeen to go aboard one of their Boats, which conveyed him to the Fleet, whereupon, ſome that knew him, reſolved to watch his return; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon apprehending him, upon ſearch, two dangerous, or treaſonable Letters were found in his poſſeſſion, ſo that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing committed to Goal, he was ſome time after tryed at the King's-Bench-Bar at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and there, upon a full hearing, Convicted of High-Treaſon, and purſuant to that Verdict, Sentenced to be Drawn, Hanged, and Quartered, which Sentance was accordingly execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on him, near St. <hi>Thomas à Waterings,</hi> between <hi>Southwark,</hi> and <hi>Deptford,</hi> in the Kentiſh Road.</p>

            <p>This Defeat utterly broke the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures they had taken, and weakened the poor Remains of the Rebels; theſe being not only the choiceſt, but the greateſt number they could draw into the Field, being moſtly Men of deſperate Fortunes, having nothing to loſe; and therefore, contrary to what many of the Heads of their <hi>Clans,</hi> had promiſed, they took up Arms to get what they could by Plunder: For to be plain, the <hi>Highlands</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> are a ſort of People, that have rarely any Conſideration of Honour, Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, Obedience or Government, than what conſiſts with their Profit; and therefore in all Revolutions and Changes, are ready to break out into Rebellion, Robbing, Plundering, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity offers: if there be a Mark or Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtep of Religion amongſt them, 'tis that of the <hi>Roman Catholick;</hi> and by ſome inſinuating Perſons of that perſwaſion,

And now, though what we are about to relate, may ſeem a kind of Digreſſion, yet being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to Hiſtory of this kind, it will not be out of the way to relate it.</p>
            <p>After the late King left <hi>Ireland,</hi> he haſted to St. <hi>Germains</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> to give perhaps the firſt notice of his defeat; at which the People exceedingly won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, for they could not apprehend the cauſe of his Return, at a time when they were held in hand, that the Engliſh were beat by Sea and Land; for ſo the Rumour was ſpread to bear up their Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, fancying to themſelves, that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing his Succeſs, and having ſubdued all <hi>Ireland,</hi> he ſhould rather have paſſed over into <hi>England,</hi> where as it was hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reported, the People would receive him with open Arms; this began to make the more thinking part of them imagine he was utterly defeated, and his Forces had received the Foil; and it was reported, that the Iriſh had given
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:38581:47"/>Ground at the River <hi>Boyne,</hi> but they eaſily comforted themſelves for that inconſiderable Loſs when it was told them, that the Duke of <hi>Schomberg</hi> was dead; and ſoon after the News ſpread of the Death of King <hi>William;</hi> at this they were ſo over-joyed, that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver enquired into the Proofs of it; the Report of one of the late King's Lack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queys, who got out of <hi>Ireland</hi> ſome few days after the Battel, was ſufficient to perſwade the whole Court of the truth of it; and it was about Midnight they received the News of King <hi>William</hi>'s Death; yet though it is not uſual to make Bonfires for the Death of an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, before he is defeated in Battel, the Commiſſaries immediately run about the Streets, crying out to the People, to riſe and make Bonfires; ſo that in leſs than two hours all <hi>Paris</hi> ſhined with Fires, and nothing was to be heard but the Shouts of the People, Drums, Trumpets, and Hoitboys; after this the Rabble made the Effigies of King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> dragged them through the Streets, and at laſt threw them into a Fire; the Bells rung, and the great Guns roared from the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> nor was any thing omitted, that is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:38581:47"/>done on ſuch occaſions. This Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing continued for ſeveral days, and though the Dutch <hi>Gazette,</hi> which they received ſome days after, expreſly told them that King <hi>William</hi> was in good Health; and notwithſtanding they had no Letters from Count <hi>Lauzun,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the firſt News, yet they would not give over their Credulities, and held it a Crime, that any ſhould queſtion the truth of it; the Phyſicians were likewiſe conſulted, who gave their Opinion, that the Wound of a Cannon Bullet was mortal, and they concluded, becauſe King <hi>William</hi> had received ſuch a Wound, he muſt of neceſſity be dead: but now let us leave <hi>France</hi> to its miſtake and folly, and return to <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King having ſecured the City of <hi>Duklin</hi> in truſty bands, and appointed all things neceſſary for its ſafety and well being, publiſhed, for the greater Settlement of the People minds, an Act of Oblivion, to all that had ſubmitted, or ſhould ſubmit before the <hi>11th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> which, together, with the Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency uſed towards thoſe who had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſubmitted, wrought ſo effectually, that a great number layed down their Arms and ſubmitted, his Majeſty ſtill
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:38581:48"/>appointing Sheriffs and other Officers, as he paſſed through the Countries that yielded him obedience; and to ſhew his extream Love to the Duke of <hi>Schom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi> and how much he was troubled for his Death, and ſenſible of the Services he had done him, expreſſed both his Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and Gratitude in the moſt obliging Terms to Count <hi>Menard</hi> his Son, and as a Pledge of his future kindneſs, gave him the place of Grand Maſter of the Artillery, which was before poſſeſſed by his Father.</p>
            <p>Thus this Succeſsful Battel, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſettled the Affairs of <hi>Ireland,</hi> a great many conſiderable Towns, Caſtles, and ſtrong Places ſurrendring, ſo that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty believing his Preſence more uſeful in <hi>England,</hi> reſolved to repaſs the Seas; but then underſtanding that things were Calm and in good Order, and that there was no further fear of the French upon the Coaſt this Year, he reſolved to ſtay longer; and having reduced <hi>Waterford, Duncannon,</hi> &amp;c. he cauſed the Army to advance towards <hi>Limerick,</hi> where <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> and <hi>Lauzun</hi> had rallied and drawn together the late King's broken Army; and on the <hi>19th.</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> our Forces came within ſight of the Town, and in the mean time General <hi>Douglas</hi>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:38581:48"/>lay before <hi>Athlone,</hi> where his men ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very much, eſpecially the Cavalry; for the Iriſh had waſted the Country, and deſtroyed the Forage for ten miles round, of which his Majeſty being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, thought it convenient not to ſpend more time in that Enterprize; whereupon General <hi>Douglas</hi> had Orders to quit <hi>Athlone,</hi> and joyn the Body of the Army at a place appointed. But no ſooner did <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> and <hi>Lauzun</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the approach of the Engliſh Forces, but leaving Monſieur <hi>Boiſleau</hi> Governour, they retired from the Walls of the City, having furniſhed it as well as they could, with all things neceſſary for defence; and <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> retired with the main Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Iriſh ſeveral miles into the Country, whilſt <hi>Lauzun</hi> with his French, expecting there to imbark for <hi>France;</hi> but the Inhabitants inſtead of receiving them, ſhut their Gates, and would not let them enter; inſomuch, that they were conſtrained to Encamp before that place, and endure much Hardſhip, till <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> prevailed by Letters to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants for their Admittance, where they committed divers Outrages, and we are told, ſome, who at firſt had op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed their Entrance, were put to Death.</p>
            <pb n="92" facs="tcp:38581:49"/>
            <p>When our Army came near <hi>Limerick</hi> the Enemy was poſted about a mile from the Town on the othèr ſide of the River, Firing from the Thickets and other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces very furiouſly upon our men, though without doing any conſiderable Damage, and being beaten back, the King, though it was late, reſolved to paſs the River, and attack the Enemy in their Retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Poſts on the other ſide; but upon debate the Officers declared their Sentiments, that it was now late, and that his Majeſty might do it with more conveniency the next Morning; but by that time, through ſear, the Iriſh had diſlodged in ſuch haſte, that they had left part of their Tents, Arms and Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage behind them; ſo that the River pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at this time ſhallower than had been known for many Years, the Engliſh paſſed without reſiſtance, and encamped within Cannon ſhot of the Town, and raiſed Works to ſecure them from the ſhot of the great Guns, yet they received ſome Damage by them; whereupon his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty ſent to Summon the Commander <hi>

               </hi> to ſurrender, and offered advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious Conditions on that Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but he ſent back word in a Letter to his Majeſties Secretary, becauſe he
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:38581:49"/>would wave giving the King the Title of Majeſty, wherein he wrote, that the Town was intruſted to his keeping, by Perſons whom he was obliged to obey, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that the P of <hi>Orange</hi> would have a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mean opinion of him if he ſhould ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, before ſo much as a Gun was fired at him; wherefore he was reſolved to defend the place to the laſt Extremity, whereby he hoped to gain his Highneſs's Eſteem.</p>
            <p>Upon this, the Trenches were opened, and the great Guns were impatiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected at the Camp to batter the Walls; but the Convoy that guarded them, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with divers Waggons laden with Ammunition and Proviſion, were ſurpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a numerous Party, under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Collonel <hi>Sarsfield,</hi> who killed ſeveral before they could put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into a poſture of defence; not ſparing the Waggoners Wives and Children, they brought in their Arms; they likewiſe burnt ſome of the Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, and Carriages of the Cannon, nai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling up ſome of the great Guns, and broke others; but the Allarm being taken by the Engliſh Forces, lying there about, the Chevalier <hi>Cunningham,</hi> who Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the <hi>Iniskilling</hi> men, having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it, marched directly towards

            <p>All theſe pregnant Reaſons obliged his Majeſty to abandon the Siege, and refer the reducing <hi>Limerick</hi> to a more favourable Seaſon and Opportunity; ſo that after he had raiſed the Siege, and found that the Seaſon would not permit him the undertaking of any Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion meriting his Preſence, he reſolved to return for <hi>England,</hi> conſtituting the Lord Viſcount <hi>Sidney,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Conningsby</hi> Governours of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving as well as could be expected, ſettled the other Offices and Truſts in confiding hands, and giving all neceſſary Orders, his Majeſty embarked, Accompanied by the Prince of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and attended by his men at <hi>Duncannon,</hi> and arrived ſafe at <hi>Kingſroad</hi> near <hi>Briſtol;</hi> and ſo having Dined at a Farmer's-houſe by the way, to put off the many Invitations of the Nobility that time would have delayed, he came to <hi>Windſor,</hi> to the extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Joy, and Rejoycing of the whole Kingdom, for his ſafe Return and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs

            <p>The Queen, in whom the Regency was placed, during the King's abſence, managed the weighty Affairs of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with extraordinary Prudence and Conduct, as appeared in the raiſing the <hi>Militia,</hi> and keeping a ſtrict Eye over ſuch diſſaffected Perſons, as perhaps wanted but an opportunity to riſe in Arms, had they found the French for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to Land; but her Majeſties Care, and the good Order ſhe took for every thing, broke all their Meaſures, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the miſchiefs that threatned the Kingdom; ſo that the French Fleet as ſtrong and numerous as they were, durſt attempt nothing conſiderable on the Coaſt; the <hi>Militia</hi> of <hi>London</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their willing and chearful Reſolution, to oppoſe the Attempts of the Enemy in a gallant appearance in <hi>Hide-Park,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her Majeſty, to her great Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; being between 9 and 10000 ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual men, well Armed and appointed, and the whole <hi>Militia</hi> of <hi>England</hi> up in Arms in their reſpective Counties, were computed to be about 150000 Horſe and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:38581:53"/>Foot: Upon Complaints againſt the Earl of <hi>Torrington,</hi> for the Miſcarriage in the Fleet, he was ſent for in Cuſtody of Meſſengers, and appeared before the Council at <hi>White Hall,</hi> by whom in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard there were ſtrong preſumptions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Lordſhip, he was committed to the Tower, and carried thither by Water, to prevent, perhaps, any Rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that might have been occaſioned by the incenſed Rabble.</p>
            <p>The wounded of Dutch and Engliſh Seamen came daily to <hi>London,</hi> where they were provided for in the ſeveral Hoſpitals, the People, all the way they came, beſtowing Money on them; and when they were recovered, Care wasta. ken to ſend the former into <hi>Holland;</hi> and as ſoon as we had certain informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the French Fleet had quitted the Coaſt, and were gone into their Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, the Trained-Bands, and other <hi>Militia</hi> were ſent home; in the mean time a great many Hands were ſet at work, to Rig and Equip the Fleet with all ſpeed, ſo that 32 Men of War rode at <hi>Spithead,</hi> and the Dutch had recruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again to 28 ſtout Ships, and came to to the <hi>Gunfleet,</hi> having immediate Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to joyn the Engliſh, and eight Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:38581:54"/>were embarked at <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> not counting the Marine Regiments, Commanded by the Earl of <hi>Marlboróugh</hi> in Chief, as General, and Mr. <hi>Trelaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> as Major-General; there was ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped likewiſe, all manner of Warlike Ammunition, and in brief, whatever is neceſſary for the Field, or the Siege of Towns; ſo that it being not certainly known on what deſign they were bent at ſuch a ſeaſon of the Year, the Peoples Conjectures were various; but it ſoon appeared they were bound for <hi>Ireland,</hi> and what they did there you'll find in the ſequel of this Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>About this time we had News of the great Succeſs of the Engliſh over the French in <hi>America,</hi> and that they had beaten them out of the Iſle of St. <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtophers,</hi> and many other places of Note, and taken great Booties of Cattel, Corn, and others Stores, and Proviſions: And from <hi>America</hi> we have further notice, that a great number of French were, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Articles agreed on, ſent to <hi>Martinico,</hi> and that the Engliſh had reduced the Fort on the Iſland of <hi>Statie;</hi> and farther Advice, that two of our Privateers fell in with Twelve Merchant Ships on the Coaſt of <hi>England,</hi> bound
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:38581:54"/>for St. <hi>Maloes,</hi> under the Convoy of a Frigat of Twelve Guns, and took four of them, forcing the reſt on ſhore about <hi>Cherbourg,</hi> where they were all ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracked, except the Frigat, and moſt of the Men drowned.</p>
            <p>On the Eighth of <hi>September,</hi> the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament met at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> when, after a ſhort continuance, the Houſe of Peers adjourned to the Friday following, and the Commons till the enſuing Thurſday; and His Majeſty was pleaſed to order in Council, a Commiſſion to be prepared for the Proroguing the Parliament, to the ſecond day of <hi>October</hi> enſuing, and a Proclamation was iſſued out, to give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that the Parliament ſhould then ſit; and to require the Peers of this Realm, and the Knights, Citizens, and Burgeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Houſe of Commons, to give their Attendance on the ſaid ſecond day of <hi>October</hi> accordingly; and no ſooner was the notice of His Majeſties Glorious Atchievements ſpread abroad, but the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours, and Miniſters of Forreign Potentates, congratulated his Succeſs, and Univerſal Joy, filled the Courts of the Neighbouring Princes.</p>
            <p>The Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> ſitting, gave their Majeſties a new Subſidy of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:38581:55"/>three Months Ceſs on Lands, and layed a Tax of Fourteen Pence upon every Fire-Hearth, (Hoſpitals, and ſuch as live upon Charity, only accepted,) and a diſcovery was made, that the Collonels, <hi>Buchan,</hi> and <hi>Cannon,</hi> intended to go Northward, and joyn the Earl of <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth,</hi> and the reſt of thoſe of the Name of <hi>Mekenzy,</hi> to have ſurprized the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of <hi>Inverneſs;</hi> but they marching over the Hills, and coming within Eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Miles of <hi>Sterling,</hi> where the Earl of <hi>Drumlanerig</hi> was poſted with 3000 Horſe and Foot, he attacked them, and the Major-General <hi>Mackay</hi> being in the Rear, as in purſuit, upon the Advice that had been given; the deſign was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together fruſtrated, and the Rebels ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged, after a long fatigue, to ſhift for themſelves, receiving a conſiderable Loſs, inſomuch, that they being daily diſcouraged, again dwindled away, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the fair promiſes that had been made them of extraordinary ſupply of Men, and Money; and the wiſer part, or ſuch as had other ways wherewithal to ſubſiſt, withdrew, and left the more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate, to ſtrive againſt the Stream, that would in all probability drive them back to their Ruine; and perhaps after
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:38581:55"/>the many Attempts of open Force, our Enemies might have proceeded to have given us the moſt fatal blow in the world, by baſe and ignoble ways, and villainous attempts. We ſhall for once, begging his pardon in this matter, quote the New Obſervator, an Author of Credit.</p>
            <p>
               <q>When we reflect, (ſays he) upon the horrible Methods put in practice by this Embroiler of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi>
               </q> (meaning, as we ſuppoſe, by the foregoing Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphs, the French King) <q>to rid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of thoſe he fears; there are to be found in all the Steps of all Illuſtrious Life, ſome of the brighteſt Rays of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign Providence, that in an eſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, watches over Kings. If a certain great man, (ſays he) late in their Majeſties own hearing, had not given a hint of a ſingular piece of Villany deſigned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their wonderful Life; I ſhould not have ventured to mention it here, though acquainted with it before: Yes! to the Eternal Infamy of the Apollion of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> be it ſaid, That ſacred Life was in equal hazard from the Cannons, and from the Poniard, and from a Poniard employed, and payed by <hi>France;</hi> what all the Engines of Death were not able to do in the field, was to be ſupplied by an Aſſaſſinate at home, and the thred of
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:38581:56"/>a glorious Life which ſtood proof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all Efforts of open War, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to be cut off by a ſecret Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Let then this deſigned Parricide, be ranked amongſt the reſt of the inglori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Actions of a Reign, fatal to its own Subjects, to its Neighbours, and to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in general; and if there be any knowledge of Humane Affairs in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World, let the Manes of the Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> reſt ſatisfied with the approaching Revenge of a Prince his Friend, upon their common Enemy that had doomed them both, tho' with different Succeſs, to the ſame diſmal Fate.</q> And thus far this Author, in this Matter, to whoſe judicious Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, in other caſes, we refer the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as approved, and applauded by moſt.</p>
            <p>By this we may ſee, the perſons of good Kings are Sacred, and above com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Danger, the Eyes of Providence ever watching over them, and the Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian-Angels ever hovering round about them, that they may remain in ſafety, even when the greateſt Dangers threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>
            <p>About this time the Dutch &amp; Engliſh Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateers made great prize of the French,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:38581:56"/>three Dutch Privateers arriving on the 16th. of <hi>September</hi> with ſeven Prizes at <hi>Mounts-Bay,</hi> where they had been crui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and ſome of the French Privateers thinking to fetch them up, and recover the Prizes, were put to flight upon the appearance of Sir <hi>Clouſly Shovel,</hi> with the Squadron of Engliſh Men of War, under his Command, who ſent two of his Frigates to give them the Chace, and three <hi>Fluſhing</hi> Privateers, one of 20, another of 16, and the third of 14 Guns, brought into the ſame Port, Nine Prizes, ſeveral of them laden with Sugars, Indico, and Tobacco, from the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> and ſome with Wines, and Brandies, and the reſt were bound for <hi>Ireland,</hi> with Neceſſaries, and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, for the ſupply of the Enemy; and Captain <hi>Young,</hi> in the <hi>Graefton</hi> Frigat, having notice, that a French Privateer of ſix Guns, and two Pattereroes, and fifty Men, had taken about <hi>Portland,</hi> a Veſſel belonging to <hi>Pool,</hi> he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſailed out of the Harbour of <hi>Wey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> and being got up with the French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, after ſome diſpute, took him, and carried him into <hi>Dartmouth,</hi> and a Dutch Caper brought in a French Veſſel of Forty Tun; and ſoon after the <hi>Graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:38581:57"/>Sloop brought into <hi>Dartmouth,</hi> a French Privateer of ſix Guns, and two Pattereroes with forty eight Men belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> which ſhe took after? running Fight of three hours, in which the French had nine Men killed; and as many wounded, and on our ſide, only four wounded; ſo that by this we may ſee if ſo many be taken in a ſhort ſpace, the French Trade, and Piracies at Sea, are in likelihood, in a fair way, to be weakened, and in a ſhort time may be brought to nothing, though their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacies on the Coaſt of <hi>Barbary,</hi> ſo often ſollicited, ſhould joyn with them in all their Deſigns, to interrupt the Trade of the two Nations.</p>
            <p>All this while the Affairs of <hi>Scotland</hi> went on very proſperouſly, and the face of things of that Kingdom looked very pleaſantly, the King's Forces prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all places, and even thoſe that headed the Rebels were diſheartned, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on notice the French Fleet was gone home, and that no Commotions happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>England,</hi> to favour their Deſign; but that which diſquieted them moſt, was the diſappointments of Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Proviſion, without the latter, eſpecially, they knew they could not
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:38581:57"/>ſubſiſt, &amp; the Rocks &amp; Mountains afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed little, the barren Iſlands leſs, to which they had reſerved their laſt Retreat, in hopes to be fetched off; but when they were certainly informed, that the late King, and the French had left <hi>Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Boiſleau,</hi> the Governour of <hi>Lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi> had quitted that place; many threw away their Arms, and went to their Habitations, reſolving to live privately; others who were ſenſible their Characters would make them be taken notice of, came in and ſubmitted.</p>
            <p>They had notice our Fleet was abroad upon ſome extraordinary Deſign, and knew not but it was to attack them in the Rear, and by that means they ſhould be barred of any Retreat; but the Deſign of the Fleet, which made many wonder, to think whereto it would tend, was otherways diſpoſed, for it ſtood away to the Coaſt of <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſo unexpectedly to thoſe that were in Arms there for the late King, as to ſtartle, and put them into Confuſion, eſpecially on the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Coaſt, and immediately rouſed thoſe out of their Security, whoſe incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity only imagin'd it at firſt a Fantom, or a Fleet in the Clouds, only Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and not Subſtantial; but the loud
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:38581:58"/>roaring of the Cannons, to give notice of their coming to our Forces, Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered thereabouts, ſoon convinced them of their Miſtake.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Marlborough</hi> arriving with the Fleet in <hi>Cork</hi> Harbour, reſolving to attack that place, Major-General <hi>Scra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venmore</hi> with 1200 Horſe, and Dragoons, who, together, with Major-General <hi>Tet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teau,</hi> and two Battalions of <hi>Danes</hi> who were poſted near the black Water, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to joyn him, and ſoon after ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Detachments out of the Dutch, and French Regiments, which with thoſe Danes, the Prince of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands in Perſon, made a Body of about 4000 Foot; and although a ſtrong Party of the Enemy were gathered under the Duke of <hi>Berwick,</hi> who ſtiled himſelf Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Commander of <hi>Ireland;</hi> they up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the News of this important Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of our Sea, and Land-Forces re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated from <hi>Bri,</hi> and were followed by Lieutenant General <hi>Douglas,</hi> with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to attack them, but were hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in that deſign, by the Bogs, and Defiles that covered the Enemies Camp. And about this time we had notice, that the Earl of <hi>Tyrconnel,</hi> and the Count <hi>De Lauzun</hi> were gone for <hi>France</hi> with
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:38581:58"/>the French Forces as deſpairing of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Intereſt of King <hi>James</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> having ſet ſail two days ſooner than was deſigned, upon notice, that a squadron of Engliſh Ships, were coming that way, and therefore their haſty flight occaſioned them to leave many of their Sick in the Suburbs of <hi>Galloway.</hi>

            <p>The Fleet, as is ſaid, arriving the 21ſt. of <hi>September,</hi> before <hi>Cork</hi> Harbour, came to an Anchor, the Floud being down, and little Wind, and the next day entered the Harbour, receiving ſome Shot from a Battery of eight Guns, but having ſent two or three Armed Boats on ſhore, the Enemy were forced from their Guns, and they being diſmounted, their Carriages, were thrown into the Sea: the following day about four in the Morning, the greateſt part of the Land-Forces were ſent up to the Paſſage, ſix Miles from <hi>Cork,</hi> the reſt marching in the Afternoon; ſo that the 24th. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 5 and 600 Seamen, Gunners, and Carpenters were Detached, to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in mounting, and placing the Cannon, to batter the Town, and then, before day, divers Boats with Armed Men, were ſent up to aſſiſt in attacking the place, Stores and Proviſions for their

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:38581:59"/>Hoſtages were exchanged; but the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my not agreeing to the Terms pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, on the <hi>8th.</hi> in the Morning, Four Regiments were appointed under the Command of Brigadier <hi>Churchill,</hi> to paſs to the Iſland lying near the Wall, where the Breach was made, which paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing through the Water; they perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with great Courage, although at Low-tide it was up to the Armpits; the Granadiers Commanded by the Lord <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> having the Van, marched for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, expoſed to all the Enemies Fire, through the Iſland, within 20 Yards of the Town-wall. Among the Voluntiers, who went on with the firſt Detachment, were the Duke of <hi>Grafton,</hi> who was dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly wounded with a Shot, of which ſoon after he died; the Lord <hi>O Brian,</hi> Collonel <hi>Granville,</hi> Captain <hi>Cornwall,</hi> Captain <hi>Leighton,</hi> Captain <hi>Fairborne,</hi> Captain <hi>Neville,</hi> and ſeveral other Sea-Officers; and immediately after this, the Enemy beat a Second Parley, but the Lord <hi>Marlborough</hi> would allow them no other Conditions, than to be Priſoners of War, and to that they agreeing, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulation was Signed.</p>
            <pb n="114" facs="tcp:38581:60"/>
            <p>And was to this Effect, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Garriſon ſhould be received Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of War, that there ſhould be no prejudice done to the Officers, Soldiers or Inhabitants; that the General would uſe his endeavour to obtain his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Clemency towards them; that they ſhould deliver up the Old Fort within an hour, and the Two Gates of the City, the next day at 8 in the Morning; that all the Proteſtant Priſoners ſhould be immediately releaſed; that all the Arms of the Garriſon, and Inhabitants ſhould be put into a ſecure place, and that an exact Account ſhould be given of the Magazines, as well Proviſion, as Ammunition; and accordingly the ſame Night, we put 200 men into the Old Fort, and the next Morning took Poſſeſſion of the Town; the Garriſon, which conſiſted of between 4 and 5000 men, being made Priſoners of War, according to the Articles of Agreement, among whom of Note, were the Earls of <hi>Clancarty</hi> and <hi>Tyrone,</hi> Collonel <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Upon this great Succeſs, the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies flying, Army retired farther, and a Detachment of Horſe and Dragoons, were ſent out of our Camp, to Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon the Town and Forts of <hi>Kingſale;</hi> a very advantagious Sea-Port, and things being put in order here, the Army ſoon followed; for on the <hi>1ſt.</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Marlborough</hi> marched out of <hi>Cork</hi> to <hi>Five-mile-Bridge</hi> and the next day came near the Town, which was poſſeſſed by an advanced Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who prevented the Enemy from burning it in their retreat to the Forts; and towards the Evening he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped, and took his Poſts about the new Fort, and Major General <hi>Tetteau</hi> was ordered with 800 men to attack the Old Fort, in which the Deſerters and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers reported, there were but 150; in order to which, he paſſed the River in Boats, he found there, which prevented his going ten miles about, and by break of day, on the <hi>3d.</hi> of <hi>October</hi> ſtormed the place, making a ſhew of attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, where it was weakeſt; whilſt in the mean time, he a cauſed Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to make an Aſſault in another place, where the Enemy leaſt appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended it; and this ſucceeded ſo well,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:38581:61"/>that our Men all at once gained the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, at what time ſeveral Barrels of Powder took fire, and blew up above 50 of the Enemy, and many others were killed by our men, the reſt flying into an old Caſtle in the midſt of the Fort; for inſtead of 150 as had been reported, there were about 450 men in the place, of which about 220 were killed and blown up, and the reſt ſubmitting, were made Priſoners.</p>
            <p>During this Conſternation, ſome en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to eſcape to the New Fort by Water, and the Tide being againſt them, they were moſtly killed in their Boats, by our Shot from the Shoar; as for the Governour of this Fort, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Officers, they were found dead upon the Ramparts, and our Soldiers got a great deal of Plunder.</p>
            <p>This Fort being intirely won, the Lord <hi>Marlborough</hi> ſent to Summon the New Fort, that yet held out; to which, the Governour ſent word, that it would be time enough to Talk of that a Month hence: whereupon the heavy Cannon coming up, two Attacks were ordered to be made by the Engliſh on the Right, and the <hi>Danes</hi> on the Left, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, from the Batteries raiſed, to

            <p>As ſoon as the Fleet, commanded by Captain <hi>Lawrénce Wright,</hi> arrived at <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis,</hi> the Governour raiſed the Forces of that Iſland, and of <hi>Antigoa</hi> and <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrat,</hi> and Embarking, ſet Sail towards St. <hi>Chriſtopher</hi>'s, and came to <hi>Frigats-Bay,</hi> with a Deſign to Land ſome For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; but finding the Coaſt Guarded by about One thouſand men, that had ſtrongly intrenched it, it was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that Sir <hi>Timothy Thornhill</hi> with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Four or five thouſand men, ſhould Land the following Night in another ſmall Bay, about half a mile from that, and fall upon the Backs of the Enemy in their Trenches, and by that means facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the Landing of the reſt at <hi>Frigats-Bay,</hi> and accordingly about one in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they were all Landed, and were guided over the Mountains by a <hi>Negro,</hi> and by break of day they met a Party of the Enemy, but ſoon routed them, and beat them to their main Body; ſo that in this Conſternation, General <hi>Codring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> Landed with about 600 men, and attacked the Enemy on the other ſide, who after a reſiſtance of Two hours were beaten from their Trenches, and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:38581:63"/>put to flight, and during the heat of this Action, the reſt of our Forces land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and pitched their Colours in the the French Trenches; and being put in Order marched towards <hi>Backſtar;</hi> but in about 4 miles march they found the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, that had Rallied and poſted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween, Two Hills; ſo that a hot Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute began, but our men advancing cloſe upon them, after an hours fighting, put them to flight, and ſo marched to <hi>Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtar</hi> without Interruption; whereupon Captain <hi>Wright</hi> weighed with his Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron, and Sailed down to <hi>Backſtar</hi> Road, with a Reſolution to batter the Town and Fort; but the Enemy ſpared him that trouble, for they had abandoned them before his coming, and fled to the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, leaving part of the Town on Fire; and in the mean time the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral continued his March with the Land-Forces, and Lodged them on a plain about a mile beyond the Town, near the <hi>Jeſuites College;</hi> having ſent a Party to the Town to quench the fire, which they quickly did.</p>
            <p>In theſe Actions we had about 130 men killed and wounded, and ſome of them of Note, and of the Enemy about 200 were killed; however, the General
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:38581:63"/>reſolved to follow the Enemy, and the Fleet thereupon ſet Sail into <hi>Old Road,</hi> near which the Land Forces then encam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and brought ſeveral Guns on ſhoar; it was reſolved, that a Battery ſhould be raiſed againſt a Fort the Enemy had there, and after a conſiderable Battery, and forcing the main Body of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to retire, that then lay encamped at a ſmall diſtance, the Fort deſired a Truce for Three days, and the next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſent Articles about ſurrendering being allowed to march out with all the Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage they could carry, and about Forty Gentlemen with their Arms: this Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon at the beginning of the Siege con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of 480 men, but 60 were killed and wounded in the Siege.</p>
            <p>Upon this Surrender, Sir <hi>Timothy Thornhill</hi> with his Regiment marched to the Iſland of St. <hi>Euſtacia,</hi> where he Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without any reſiſtance; they had in that Iſland a ſtrong Fort, which, upon the ſight of our Land-Forces and Fleet, beat a Parley, and though at firſt they came to no Agreement, yet ſeeing our great Guns mounted, they upon a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Partly ſurrendered, upon the Terms given thoſe of St. <hi>Chriſtopher</hi>'s; and in this Fort there were about 80 men, ſo that

            <p>And now divers Addreſſes were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to his Majeſty, to Congratulate his Safety and happy Return; and the Parliament was not ſlow in conſidering ways, to raiſe a conſiderable Fund of Money, to carry on vigorouſly the War at Land and Sea; for although a great part of <hi>Ireland</hi> was reduced by the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of his Majeſties Arms, yet thoſe that held out were not ſo contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but they might be doubted: And indeed, ſoon after the taking <hi>Kingſale,</hi> the Enemy with 1500 Horſe and Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons

The Deſign of expelling the Rebels out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> was about this time put in Execution with great Vigour; ſo that it was thought convenient to diſpoſſeſs them of the ſtrong Holds, they yet main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in that Kingdom; and thereupon the Caſtle of <hi>Fedret</hi> was attacked, but thoſe that were in Garriſon perceiving our Forces preparing to Storm it, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a Parley, and after a ſhort time to

            <p>In the beginning of the Year 1695. the Parliament having given the King Liberal ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, greater Preparations than the laſt were made, and the Confederates were in a conſiderable Poſture; ſo that the King early in the Spring went by the way of <hi>Holland</hi> to <hi>Flanders,</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with divers Nobles, and put the Army in ſuch a Poſture, as not to fear the Attacks of the Enemy, but rather to ſeek them, and dare them to Battel.

However the <hi>French</hi> for a time retaind the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon Soldiers, and compelled moſt of them to Enter into their Service againſt their minds. This much diſſatisfied the King of <hi>England,</hi> and thereupon after many Skirmiſhes that happened between Parties, he laid Seige to <hi>Namure,</hi> a City that Commanded a large Province; where the <hi>French</hi> had geathered great Riches, and accordingly on the third of <hi>July</hi> it was In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted, and the Siege carried on with all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable Vigor, by the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> and other Princes, ſo that the City was taken, but then the Marsſchal <hi>de Boufflers</hi> who had thrown himſelf into it, retired to the Caſtle on the other ſide the River, upon Articles ſigned the fourth of <hi>August</hi> by the Elector of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and Count <hi>Guiſcard</hi> Governour of the place, a Second Siege in a manner was laid to the Caſtle, being very ſtrongly Fortified, and in it a numerous Gariſon, yet ſuch was the Courage of the Confederates, that they gave the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged little Reſt, the Batteries Inceſſantly play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and divers Bombs thrown into the Caſtle and out-works, which did great damage; and though when the Trenches approached, the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:38581:102"/>Enemy made divers vigorous Sallies yet were they beaten off with conſiderable loſs, and many brave Officers on both ſides ſlept in the Bed of Honour. But whilſt they manfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, the Place Expecting to be relieved; <hi>Villeroy</hi> with an Army of 100000 Men ſtood looking on, not daring to Attack the out-Guards of the Confederates; and at laſt having made ſome Bravadoes, drew off, writing in Excuſe to his Maſter, that he had called ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Councils of War, wherein the General Officers unanimouſly. Concurred that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates lay ſo Advantageouſly poſted, that it was not ſafe to hazard the Succeſs of a Battle.</p>
            <p>The Beſieged being in this manner left to ſhift for themſelves, the Beſiegers having beaten down a great part of the Works, prepared for a general Aſſault, both upon the Caſtle and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn-Fort,</hi> and the Signal was given to fall on with 10000 Men, the Lord <hi>Cutts</hi> with 3000 <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Bavarians;</hi> Major General <hi>Le Cave</hi> with 2000 <hi>Brandenburghers,</hi> and Major General <hi>Swerin</hi> with 2000 <hi>Dutch;</hi> one upon the <hi>Devils-houſe,</hi> and two upon Fort <hi>William,</hi> and the Fourth upon <hi>Terra Nova:</hi> The Encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was Bloody and Obſtinate for four hours; however at length the Beſiegers became Maſters of the <hi>Devils-houſe</hi> and <hi>Cohorn-Fort,</hi> lodging themſelves therein; but the Attack upon <hi>Terra-Nova</hi> had not the ſame Succeſs, where after they had planted their Colours on the Breaches of the Old Caſtle, they were repulſed by the Beſieged. During this Aſſault the Enemy Sprang two Mines; the Beſiegers by caſting in Bombs, blew up two ſmall Magazines in <hi>Williams</hi> Fort, and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:38581:103"/>the next day every thing was in readineſs for a ſecond General Aſſault; and the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> to Encourage his Officers and Soldiers, promiſed a Reward to every one according to their Demerits But the Beſieged prevented it by a timely Parley, which attended by the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render of the Caſtle: The effect of the Articles of Surrender being theſe;</p>
            <p>That the outward Fortifications ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd up on the ſecond of <hi>September,</hi> by nine in the Morning.</p>
            <p>That the Beſieged ſhould quit the Caſtle the 5th, with 2.24 Pownders, 2.12 Pown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and 2.6 Pownders, 2 Mortars.</p>
            <p>That they ſhould be furniſhed with Horſes for their Cannon and Mortars; and Waggons, and Boats to Convey the Garriſon thence, with what Baggage ſhould be allowed them.</p>
            <p>That the Beſieged ſhould leave Officers and Commiſſaries to take care of the Sick and Wounded, and the remaining Baggage that cannot be carried away when the Garriſon Marches out, and other Articles to the ſame purpoſe. And thus was the famous City and Caſtle of <hi>Namure</hi> Regained, after it had been three Years in the Hands of the <hi>French;</hi> and in it the Enemy loſt about 11000 Men, and the Confederates not a leſs number before the Town and Caſtle: But upon the paſſing out of the Garriſon, the Mareſchal de <hi>Boufflers</hi> was Arreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by way of reprizal for the Troops and Foot Forces detained, contrary to the Cartel, that were taken in the Garriſons of <hi>Dixmuyde,</hi> &amp;c. But he was Honourably uſed, and upon an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from the <hi>French</hi> King for the Releaſe of theſe Soldiers, Ordering them to be Reduced
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:38581:103"/>under their former Commands, he was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, though he departed with much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, and not without Muttering ſome threats, which no doubt he hoped to put in Practice, if Heaven by a wonderful Providence had not prevented the intended Aſſaſſination, and Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, which on all Hands is Evident he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of.</p>
            <p>The Siege ended, and no Enemies that might give Suipicion of Danger appearing in the Field, the place was ordered to be Fortified, and a good Gariſon put into it, and ſome other places of leſſer Note being Secured.

            <p>But whilſt he was Conſulting the good of his People, reſtleſs minds were at Work to Involve us in Blood and Ruin, being agitated and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by the Courts at <hi>Verſalies</hi> and St. <hi>Germain:</hi> For divers Perſons coming over to that end, of which Sir <hi>George Barklay</hi> as yet ſeems the chief Agent; a deſign was contrived againſt the moſt Precious Life in the World; in order according to the uſual <hi>French</hi> Method, to Facilitate an Invaſion: So mean a Barbaritie, when a Prince Expoſes himſelf ſo bravely in the Field, in the Head of his Army againſt the moſt daring of his Enemies; that certainly no Barbarian can refrain to abhor and deteſtate what you will find in the Remainder of this hiſtory, to be contrived by one who vainly Stiles him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the Great, whilſt the <hi>Magni</hi> bluſh to allow ſuch an Epethite to any, but the Brave and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous.</p>

            <p>A horrid Conſpiracy againſt the King's Life was contrived in <hi>France,</hi> and divers Ruffians ſent over to Execute it, to favour an Invaſion by King <hi>James,</hi> with a <hi>French</hi> Power: For tho' their purpoſe was defeated <hi>Anno:</hi> 1692. by the Deſtruction of their Fleet at <hi>La Hogue,</hi> and in other Ports, they gave not over their deſign; for I find from that time it continued privately to be carried on in Expectation of a more favourable opportunity: And tho' the Conſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirators met with many diſappointments, they conſidered not the Providence that ſo Ordered it, but went raſhly on in their wicked purpoſes, till many of them were taken in the Snare they were ſo ſecretly laying for others: And Winter laſt was Twelve-Months, they began to puſh on with Vigour, though they found <hi>Grandval</hi> had miſcarried, and was deſervedly Executed, as has been ſaid; and in <hi>January</hi> 1695. divers were ſent over from <hi>France,</hi> to receive Orders from Sir <hi>George Barklay</hi> here, for Aſſaſſinating the King; who as a Mark to be known by them, had always when he went abroad a white Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief, half Hanging out of his Pocket; and ſeveral were Entred into Pay, the Troopers that came over having five Shillings a day Subſiſtence Mony; and in <hi>January</hi> there were ſeveral meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings about concerting this wicked Affair: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they came to no poſitive Reſult, as to the manner of Acting it till <hi>February.</hi> In the mean while they had divers Supplies of Mony, by Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from <hi>France,</hi> and on the 10th of <hi>Feb.</hi> they ſent two of their Accomplices to View the Groud, on the other ſide the Water near <hi>Richmond,</hi> how they might moſt Advantageouſly do it, when the King went a Hunting, but that
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:38581:104"/>Place was diſliked, as too Open; and they came to a point, do do it in a narrow Lane; near <hi>Turnham-Green,</hi> by about 40 Men well Arm'd on Horſe-back, moſt of the Horſes and Arms being already provided and planted at Inns and Livery-Stables, in <hi>Weſtminster, Holbourn,</hi> and about 5 in <hi>Sommerſet-Houſe,</hi> under the charge of Mr. <hi>Lewis,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Feverſham</hi>'s Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of his Horſe; So that on the 15th they made ready for this Undertaking, having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice from <hi>Chambers,</hi> and another Scout, at <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſington,</hi> that the King was to go a Hunting that day; but all was quaſhed again upon fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Notice, that his going was put off, and the Guards haſtily return'd. Yet on the 22d it was reſolved to be done near <hi>Turnham-Green,</hi> Captain <hi>Porter</hi> being to Command one Party, and Brigadier <hi>Rookwood</hi> another, to Attaque the Guards, while Sir <hi>George Barclay</hi> with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Party, was to ſet on the King's Coach, to Murder him and others they ſhould find in it. But in the mean time, remorſe of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſmote Monſieur <hi>De la Rue,</hi> who was privy to all the Deſign; that he proved reſtleſs and altogether uneaſie in his Mind, till on the 18th he went to Brigadier <hi>Leviſon</hi> with a charge ſpeedily to acquaint the King with it, which he did; and ſoon after, the Conſpirators meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Pendergraſs,</hi> one of them being abſent, they ſuſpected he had diſcovered them, and reſolved among themſelves to Stab or Piſtol him wherever they met him; of which having notice from Captain <hi>Porter,</hi> he immediately went to <hi>Kenſington</hi> and diſcovered the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy to my Lord <hi>Portland,</hi> who communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated it to the King; upon which concurring
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:38581:105"/>Informations, a Liſt was had of the Names of many of the Conſpirators, and Advertiſements from the Duke of <hi>Wirtemburg,</hi> that the French Forces to the number of 20000 were drawn down to <hi>Dunkirk, Calais</hi> and other Sea ports, where a great Fleet of Tranſport Ships and Men of War, lay ready to Embark them: Then the King put off his intended going a Broad on the 22d, and reſolutions were taken to Seize the Conſpirators; ſo that the Lord <hi>Cutts</hi> in order to it receiving his Majeſties Inſtructions, went with a ſtrong Guard, and that Night and on <hi>Sunday</hi> Morning, ſecured about Fifteen of them; and many more were ſoon after Apprehended upon His Majeſty's putting out a Proclamation, wherein divers of them were Named, with the Reward of 1000 <abbr>

            <p>Upon this, both Houſes waited on his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty with a very Loyal Addreſs. and entred into an Aſſociation to ſtand by His Majeſty; and if he ſhould come to a violent Death, to revenge it on his Enemis and their Adherents; which good Example has been ſince follow'd by the greateſt part of the Kingdom. Upon this all <hi>Papiſts</hi> were by Proclamation to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Ten Miles from the Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> except Houſe keepers and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant Strangers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And other Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were put out, to Apprehend more of the Conſpirators, as their Names came to be known; and a day of Publick Thanksgiving ordered for the diſcovery and defeat of this horrid Conſpiracy; which was Religiouſly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved <hi>April</hi> the 16th.</p>
            <p>And now the <hi>French,</hi> who ye knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this happy Diſcovery, but expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Signal from <hi>Dover,</hi> by caſting up a Bomb, as had been agreed, when the King ſhould be Murdered, were ſtranely Surpriz'd to ſee Admiral <hi>Ruſſel</hi> with a Squadron of Sixty Men of War, Fire-ſhips, Bomb ketches, and other Veſſels, on their Coaſts, blocking them up ſo; that we having beaten many of their Veſſels

            <p>Thus a wonderful Providence having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated their Deſigns, it was thought fit to bring the Coſpirators to Juſtice: and an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment of High-treaſon being found againſt <hi>Robert Charnock, Edward King,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Keys</hi> they were on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 11th of <hi>March</hi> Arrainged at the <hi>Seſſions-Houſe</hi> in the <hi>Old Baily,</hi> for deſigning the Aſſaſſination of the King, in Order to the bringing in a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Power; and a Jury of twelve Men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sworn, Captain <hi>Forter</hi> gave Evidence againſt them, that they had ſeveral meetings to Conſult about Meaſures for taking away the Life of the King, particularly at the Globe Tavern in <hi>Hatton-Garden,</hi> the Nags head in <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> at the Sun in the <hi>Strand,</hi> at the Blew-Poſts in <hi>Old Spring-Garden,</hi> and other places; that Mr <hi>Charnock</hi> had brought him Accquainted with Sir <hi>George Barcklay,</hi> and that it was agreed in theſe meetings to At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack the King's Guards and Aſſaſſinate him; and then they were to ſeize the <hi>Exchequer, Tower,</hi> and Magazens other to provide them with Money and Stores; <hi>Charnock</hi> after faying that when once the little Spark was out of the way, King <hi>James</hi> would be preſently here: He had alſo been over in <hi>France</hi> with him, to deſire him to prevaile with the <hi>French</hi> King to ſend an Army hither: That a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to Leavy War ſent: That they had often Drank a health to the Squeezing the Rotten Orange.
